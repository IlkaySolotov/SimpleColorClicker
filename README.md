# SimpleColorClicker
Scans the a window for the selected RGB colored pixel and clicks on it

This program gets only the selected window's pixels to optimize "scanning" time, otherwise
with a normal "screenshot" the hunting process would take way longer.

Simply get the window name from TaskManager, select the color with the color-picker, and click start!

I was too lazy to implement a "Repeat for" or a stop button so you will have to force stop it with ctrl+alt+canc
or simply alt-f4'ing the selected window



THIS IS A RANDOM PROJECT MADE IN 60 SECONDS DONT COMPLAIN ABOUT IT BEING ASS, ALSO DONT RIP IT FOR SHITTY GAME CHEATS OR I'LL BEAT YO ASS
